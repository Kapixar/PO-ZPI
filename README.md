# Engineering Projects Manager 🎓

Engineering Projects Manager is a web-based application designed as a conceptual implementation of selected parts of the process of submitting, managing, and approving engineering project topics and student teams at Wrocław University of Science and Technology.

The project focuses on a defined subset of the overall system and implements six use cases that reflect real academic roles and responsibilities involved in organizing team-based engineering projects.
